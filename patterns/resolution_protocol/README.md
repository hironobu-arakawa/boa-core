# Resolution Protocol (RP)
— Boundary Transition Protocol —

Resolution Protocol (RP) is  
**a transition protocol within Boundary-Oriented Architecture (BOA)**.

RP is not  
a mechanism for making decisions.

**It defines a procedure for formally returning to human judgment  
those events where decision-making cannot occur.**

---

## Position within BOA

BOA is an architecture for organizing:

- Where boundaries should be placed
- What happens at boundaries
- How responsibility is handled when boundaries are crossed

RP is responsible for:

> **"Treating events where 'judgment cannot occur here'  
> not as failures, but as 'normal transitions'."**

---

## Relationship with IDG

- **IDG (Interface Determinability Gate)**  
  Determines whether decision-making is appropriate

- **RP (Resolution Protocol)**  
  Formally transfers to human judgment  
  those events determined to be non-decidable

RP is  
**activated only on the premise of IDG's judgment result**.

---

## What RP Defines

RP defines the following structure:

- Confirmation of judgment incapability
- Explicit identification of the responsible party
- State of transition to human judgment
- Minimal information for record-keeping and audit

RP:

- Does not present solutions
- Does not make decisions on behalf
- Does not optimize

---

## On Implementation (Important)

The authoritative version of RP is  
**managed as a YAML definition**.
