# Components Map

This document defines the elements that make up BOA Core from the perspective of **"what question they exist to answer."**

RCA (agentic judge) plays the central role in judgment.

## Overview: The Three Pillars

BOA / RCA / RP each play a role in a different dimension.

1.  **BOA Core** (Structure: Separation)
2.  **RCA** (Agent: Judge)
3.  **RP** (Criteria: Protocol)

These resemble the relationship of **"Place, Person, and Rule."**

## BOA — Boundary-Oriented Architecture

**Role: Separation Function**

**Question:
"Where should the judgment take place?"**

BOA is a "structure" that separates the system via Boundaries.
It physically and logically divides the areas where AI is allowed to judge from the areas where humans must judge.

-   Creates the "place" for judgment
-   Prevents chaotic interference
-   Provides "compartments" to clarify the locus of responsibility

> **BOA does not judge. It defines the "place" where judgment occurs.**

## RCA — Responsibility Closure Agent

**Role: The Judge**

**Question:
"Will you accept this judgment?"**

RCA is the "Agent" that actually performs the judgment within the place defined by BOA.
It performs not just mechanical determination but expresses its will as an agent.

RCA indicates one of the following "intentions" regarding the input:

1.  **ACCEPTED**:
    -   "I take responsibility for this judgment and sign it."
2.  **DENIED**:
    -   "I will not judge because the conditions are not met."
3.  **UNKNOWN**:
    -   "I do not have enough information to judge."

> **RCA is not just a filter. It is the "bearer of responsibility."**

## RP — Resolution Protocol

**Role: The Criteria**

**Question:
"Is it recognized as a formal Resolution?"**

RP is the "Protocol (procedure/criteria)" for the system to formally recognize the judgment made by RCA.
Even if RCA says "I accept," if it violates organizational or system rules, RP rejects it.

What RP checks:

-   Is there an RCA signature?
-   Are the required traces present?
-   Is the responsible entity (Who) specified?

> **RP is not concerned with the content of individual judgments. It guarantees the "legitimacy of the procedure."**

---

## Why are these three needed?

-   Without **BOA (Structure)**, it becomes unclear where judgments are being made.
-   Without **RCA (Agent)**, no one takes responsibility, and only mechanical processing runs.
-   Without **RP (Criteria)**, individual arbitrary judgments would pass as organizational decisions.

With these three in place, BOA Core realizes "Responsible Autonomy."
