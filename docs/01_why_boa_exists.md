# Why BOA Exists

BOA is not the first technology.
It is the **declaration of boundary** that must be placed first.

The problem BOA attempts to solve is simple:

- How far is the AI's decision **allowed**?
- Where is it **stopped**?
- Whose **responsibility** does it become?

If these remain ambiguous,
RP and RCA lose their meaning.
