purpose:
  - Preserve accountability and explainability under policy constraints
  - Make interpretation boundaries explicit across agencies and time

core_mapping:
  Fact:
    examples:
      - citizen_requests_intake
      - case_events_and_timestamps
      - sensor_observations_infrastructure
      - budget_transactions
      - meeting_minutes_as_records
    invariants:
      - Immutable record of what happened
      - Provenance preserved (who/when/source)
      - Corrections are additive (amendment), not overwrite

  Meaning:
    examples:
      - eligibility_judgement
      - risk_classification
      - prioritization_for_service
      - policy_interpretation
    rules:
      - Meaning must declare legal/policy basis and effective date
      - Different agencies may hold different meanings for same Fact

  Responsibility:
    owners:
      - case_worker
      - department_head
      - legal_officer
      - elected_official_when_applicable
    notes:
      - Responsibility is explicitly assigned by law/process
      - Decisions must be traceable and explainable

boundaries:
  - name: intake_to_case
    description: Raw requests become a formal case with legal handling
    shifts:
      meaning: "request narrative -> case classification"
      responsibility: "front desk -> case worker"
      resolution: "case schema + required fields fixed here"

  - name: policy_change_boundary
    description: Same Facts interpreted under updated policy/rules
    shifts:
      meaning: "old policy -> new policy"
      responsibility: "policy owner -> executing departments"
      resolution: "policy version fixed per period/case type"

  - name: inter_agency_handoff
    description: Responsibility moves across departments/agencies
    shifts:
      meaning: "local interpretation -> receiving agency interpretation"
      responsibility: "agency A -> agency B"
      resolution: "handoff package definition fixed"

    guarantees:
      - "assist_only": true

      - "disclosure risk assessment"

ai_positioning:
  allowed:
    - summarize case history
    - propose policy-relevant checklists
    - detect inconsistencies or missing records
  forbidden:
    - decide eligibility
    - decide enforcement actions
    - generate official statements without approval

  idg_constraints:
    - "If policy applicability is ambiguous, AI must detach"
    - "No inference of 'intent' from incomplete records"

failure_modes:
  - name: policy_version_confusion
    symptom: "same case type yields different outcomes without declared basis"
    mitigation:
      - "Meaning must carry policy/legal version + effective date"
      - "Resolution gate for public reporting"

  - name: accountability_blur
    symptom: "decision rationale cannot be traced"
    mitigation:
      - "explicit Responsibility owner for each decision"
      - "store decision memo as Meaning artifact linked to Facts"

binding_notes:
  - "Public sector boundaries are often time-based (policy versions) and org-based (handoffs)."
  - "Resolution must include explainability and provenance requirements."
