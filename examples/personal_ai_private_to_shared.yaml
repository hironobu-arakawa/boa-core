  en: Personal AI hypotheses must be resolved before becoming shared decisions
  ja: パーソナルAIの仮説は、共有判断になる前に必ず解決（Resolution）される

domain: cross_domain

scenario:

    - An individual uses Personal AI to analyze a situation
    - The AI produces a convincing conclusion based on private context
    - The result must not cross into shared or official space without Resolution

      Crossing from private reasoning space into shared organizational space
      requires stripping personal context and declaring responsibility.

failure_modes:
  - name: silent_personal_bias
    symptom: "Shared decision reflects private preference without disclosure"
    mitigation:
      - "Explicit stripping of personal context at boundary"
      - "Resolution checklist enforcement"

  - name: ai_authority_shift
    symptom: "AI output treated as authoritative decision"
    mitigation:
      - "Mandatory human sign-off"
      - "Decision memo stored as Meaning artifact"

notes:
  - "Personal AI is a thinking partner, not a decision maker."
  - "Boundaries protect both the individual and the organization."
  - "Resolution is the moment where responsibility becomes real."
